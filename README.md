# The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods
The objective of this project is to analyze and select the best locations in the Manhattan borough, New York to open a dessert restaurant. This is a project that made the use of many data science skills, from working with API (Foursquare), data cleaning, data wrangling, to machine learning (K means clustering) and map visualization (Folium).
